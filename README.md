# Nemesis-Spammer

# Information

This tool was made around late 2023 by @clixyy, and was pretty private until it was leaked by one of the developers to me somewhere in late 2024.
It was used as a phishing tool to leak tokens from dumb users who would run it without checking the code, where hidden as a captcha-solver was a token exfiltration technique where the main variable token would be sent to the developer via a webhook hidden as base64.
I personally helped improve this tool and It was the reason my [NxA Multitool](https://github.com/emogirls/NxA-MultiTool) came to existance.
I posted it **as it was** sent to me, you have to check the code for the base64 rat (too lazy to do it myself).

Reason for leak: It is one of the founding pillars of the script spam community.
All credits for this tool go to Clixy and his helpers.
Props to them for making it, pretty nice.
